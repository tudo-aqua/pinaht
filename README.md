# Pinaht - Pinaht Is Not A Hacking Tool


Society has been digitized in the last decade.
That has lead to an amount information that we cannot handle manually.
It has also increased the number of (computer) systems tenfold.
Verifying the security of a high number systems is very time consuming.
Especially, when we consider that the number of task that are repeated, just with different inputs, is non-negligible.

Pinaht allows to automatically execute tasks to collect information about a system.
It works by storing information in a graph structure to express the relationship of the data.
Tasks that require data in a specific relationship are then executed with the data as input.

## Running Pinaht

Pinaht uses `venv`.
Modules are configured in `pinaht/pinaht/modules/module_list.py`
Pinaht is currently configured to attack all computers on the network.
It is also possible to only attack a specific computer on the network.
